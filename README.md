🤖 Rule-Based Chatbot
🚀 A simple yet intelligent chatbot that responds to user inputs using predefined rules. This chatbot follows an if-else based pattern matching approach to generate meaningful conversations, making it a great introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI-driven interactions.

🌟 Features

✅ Rule-Based Responses – Uses if-else conditions and regular expressions to recognize user queries.

✅ Interactive & Engaging – Provides relevant responses based on predefined rules.

✅ Easy to Customize – Modify or extend responses for different scenarios.

✅ Minimal Dependencies – Runs with basic Python libraries.

✅ Expandable – Can be integrated with AI models for more advanced conversations.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Regular Expressions (re module) for pattern matching

NLTK (Optional) for text preprocessing

Flask / Tkinter (Optional) for a GUI or Web App

🚀 Getting Started
🔹 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/rule-based-chatbot.git
cd rule-based-chatbot

Run the Chatbot (CLI Version)

python chatbot.py

💡 How It Works
1️⃣ User inputs a query (e.g., "Hi", "Tell me a joke", "Weather today?")
2️⃣ Chatbot matches the input using predefined rules.
3️⃣ Response is generated based on matching patterns.
4️⃣ If no rule matches, the chatbot provides a default response.
🔥 Example Conversations

User: Hi  
Chatbot: Hello! How can I assist you today?  

User: What’s your name?  
Chatbot: I’m a rule-based chatbot! 😊  

User: Tell me a joke  
Chatbot: Why don’t scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything! 😂  

User: Bye  
Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day!  

🎯 Future Improvements
🔹 Integrate Machine Learning/NLP models for dynamic responses
🔹 Expand response database for more engaging conversations
🔹 Deploy on a web app using Flask or FastAPI
🔹 Implement voice interaction with Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech

Thanks!
